# FAQ

- **WHAT IS "Generativemasks"?**  
  Generativemasks is a Generative Art NFT project based in Japan.

- **MORE SPECIFICALLY?**  
  One of the most unique things about the project and the NFT is that this NFT automatically generates masks with different expressions. What does that mean? This means that when you reload your mask or masks on the NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, you will be able to see a different colored mask with different expressions in patterns and shapes! And it happens every time you refresh your webpage. Yes, every time.

- **WHO IS THE ARTIST?**  
  The artwork was created by Takawo ShunsukeÔºàTwitter: @takawoÔºâ. He is a college professor and a creative coder in Japan. Takawo is really passionate about daily coding and his areas of expertise are design process, media art and digital fabrication.

And all of his proceeds from the project will be donated to the following organizations and groups.

    - Processing Foundation
    - Processing Community Japan
    - OpenProcessing
    - NEORT
    - Coolors

My first NFT art project "generativemasks" was launched today. The project uses p5.js to generate mask graphics from 10000 unique shapes and patterns.

Generativemasks
The inspiration for this work came from discovering a sense of life in geometric patterns that are symmetrically arranged. With unexpected shapes and patterns, I tried to express the scary yet somehow charming atmosphere of Native American totem poles and indigenous Japanese Yokai.

. 8. -- WHAT IS THE FUTURE ROADMAP OF THE PROJECT? --

   Yes, it does!
   https://twitter.com/generativemasks

10. -- „ÄéGenerativemask„ÄèIS THAT YOU? --
    No. Absolutely Not.

We already found out that there is a couple of fake accounts and collections.
We're gonna keep trying to deal with them though,
please please make sure and note that
the Real one always has "s" at the end of the word.

Example:
„ÄåGenerativemask„Äç‚áí „ÄÄ ‚úï
„ÄåGenerativemasks„Äç‚áí „ÄÄ ‚óØ

    Here is our official verified OpeaSea collection:
    https://opensea.io/collection/generativemasks

    The original mint price was 0.1 eth. (For ALL)

13. -- IS RARITY SET IN THIS NFT? --
    No, there is no rarity setting for this NFT.

14. -- DO WE GET DMS OR MESSAGE FRON THE TEAM?--
    We possibly might contact you to talk about something specific,
    (If you reach out to us for questions or things like that!)
    but one thing that we want you to know and you need to be aware of is

We never ever ask you for sending any ETH or tokens.
WE NEVER DO IT

So even though it's not us (TEAM),
Somebody within the community reaches out to you
and ask you for ETH or tokens,
You should never answer, but please report it to us. ÔºàTo RyuÔºâ

We will immediately take the proper action to deal with it.
Ryu. ‚Äî 08/24/2021 16. -- SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ROLE VERIFICATION. WHY?--
There are two main things you need to check
in order to get the role process done.

‚ë† Make sure the address you are trying to connect to in collabland
must be the same as the wallet you are holding the NFT.

ÔºàAfter checking ‚ë†, I recommend you trying one more here.Ôºâ

‚ë° Check your address of the mask NFT is correct for our contract address.
(Make sure that their alphanumeric match correctly)

Our contract address is here:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x80416304142fa37929f8a4eee83ee7d2dac12d7c

The alphanumeric you see (0x80416304142fa3~) is our contract address.
If you're not familiar with the word, that's okay.

But you need to know this alphanumeric should be the same as your URL of the NFT.
If you see the same alphanumeric there, it should be fine!

In the case you use OpenSea,
your URL of the NFT should be like this (ex: OpeanSea)

Example: https://opensea.io/assets/0x80416304142fa37929f8a4eee83ee7d2dac12d7c/012345
(\*This is just an example, you'll see errors if you go to the link)

If you need help with this, you can drop me a message!
